<P CLASS = "size2">Long Son Pagoda, also known as Chua Long Son,
 is situated on the foothill of Trai Thuy Mountain in the city 
 of Nha Trang. The temple is famous for its large white Buddha 
 image, which sits at top the mountain crest and can be seen from 
 anywhere in town. Built in 1886 in the style of Taoist architecture,
 Long Son Pagoda has been home to many high-ranking Buddhist monks and 
 the Vietnam Buddhist Studies Foundation was founded here in 1936.</P>
