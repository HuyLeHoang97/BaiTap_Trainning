<P CLASS = "size2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Po Nagar Cham temple complex was built between 
8th and 11th centuries by the Cham people who once ruled the central 
plain of Vietnam. The Cham people, who were Hindu in origin, had
their own Sanskrit-based script. They are renowned for their skills
in sculpture and architecture and left behind a legacy of artifacts
and temple settlements not only in Vietnam, but also Cambodia and Thailand.</P>
